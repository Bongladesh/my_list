 Python List Operations Project

## Description
This Python script demonstrates fundamental list operations including creation, modification, and analysis of lists. The program showcases common list methods that are essential for Python programming.

## Features
- List creation and population
- Element insertion at specific positions
- List extension with another list
- Element removal
- List sorting
- Value indexing

## Code Operations
1. Creates an empty list `my_list`
2. Appends elements: 10, 20, 30, 40
3. Inserts value 15 at the second position
4. Extends the list with [50, 60, 70]
5. Removes the last element
6. Sorts the list in ascending order
7. Finds and prints the index of value 30

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Download the script (list_operations.py)
3. Run from command line:
python list_operations.py

## Expected Output
After appending elements: [10, 20, 30, 40]
After inserting 15: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
After extending: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
After removing last element: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
After sorting: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3
